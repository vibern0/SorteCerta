# Kettigo Landing Operations

This package is the standalone public landing site and email waitlist. It builds
a Vite React frontend and a same-origin Cloudflare Worker that serves static
assets and writes D1-backed waitlist rows.

It does not connect wallets, read contracts, or change the product app
deployment. App entry is handled by `packages/web`, which reads the same
approval table.

## Local Setup

Install workspace dependencies from the repository root:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the local site:

```bash
npm run landing:dev
```

Run the automated landing checks:

```bash
npm run landing:typecheck
npm run landing:test
npm run landing:build
```

## Local D1 And Approval

Apply the local D1 migration:

```bash
npm exec --workspace @kettigo/landing wrangler d1 migrations apply kettigo-landing-local --local
```

Join the waitlist from the browser with any email. Approve an email directly in
D1 by setting `approved_at`:

```bash
npm exec --workspace @kettigo/landing wrangler d1 execute kettigo-landing-local --local --command "UPDATE waitlist_entries SET approved_at = datetime('now') WHERE email_normalized = 'person@example.com';"
```

## Production D1

Create the shared owner-operated production D1 database from `packages/landing`:

```bash
npm exec --workspace @kettigo/landing wrangler d1 create kettigo-landing
```

Copy the returned `database_id` into `packages/landing/wrangler.jsonc`,
replacing the local placeholder:

```json
"database_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

Do not invent this identifier. It must come from the Cloudflare account that
will run the Worker. Keep the `DB` binding name unchanged.

Apply the migration to the remote D1 database after the ID is configured:

```bash
npm exec --workspace @kettigo/landing wrangler d1 migrations apply kettigo-landing --remote
```

The web Worker has its own Wrangler config at `packages/web/wrangler.jsonc`.
Keep its `database_name` and `database_id` synchronized with this config so
both Workers use the same `DB` binding and schema.

The landing Worker explicitly sets an empty Cron Trigger list. Keep this in
place: the app Worker owns scheduled keeper work, while the landing Worker
only serves the site and waitlist. Wrangler otherwise leaves an existing
dashboard Cron Trigger attached when `crons` is omitted. Its no-op scheduled
handler is only a rollout safeguard; it must not replace removing accidental
triggers.

Approve remote emails with a targeted D1 update after reviewing the row.

## Production deployment

The two Workers have separate deployment targets:

| Site | Worker | Wrangler config |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `https://kettigo.xyz` | `kettigo-landing` | `packages/landing/wrangler.jsonc` |
| `https://app.kettigo.xyz` | `kettigo` | `packages/web/wrangler.jsonc` |

Use the repository's pinned `pnpm@10.11.1` from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --filter @kettigo/landing build
pnpm exec wrangler deploy --config packages/landing/wrangler.jsonc --dry-run
npm run landing:deploy
```

The deploy script also applies the empty Cron Trigger list after uploading the
Worker. Keep that step so stale keeper schedules are removed.

The landing config owns the `kettigo.xyz` custom domain. The root
`wrangler.toml` and `cf:build` script target the **app**, not the landing.
Never run an unqualified `wrangler deploy` from the repository root for the
landing Worker. Workers Builds can override the configured Worker name and
upload the app to the landing Worker even when DNS is correct.

Cloudflare Workers Builds settings for `kettigo-landing`:

- Production branch: `main`
- Root directory: `/`
- Build command: `pnpm run landing:build`
- Deploy command: `pnpm run landing:deploy`

Keep these repository scripts in the hosted build settings; the landing deploy
script supplies the explicit config path. A manual landing deployment alone
does not repair an incorrect automatic build trigger.
After deploying, confirm the apex loads `/assets/` landing bundles and shows
“Make your USDC feel lucky.”, while `app.kettigo.xyz` still loads the app's
`/_next/` bundles. Recheck after an automatic build from `main`.

## Production Smoke Tests

Exercise these flows against the preview URL before routing public traffic:

- Waitlist join: a new email returns the joined success state and inserts one
  row with `approved_at` empty.
- Replay: submitting the same email again returns the idempotent success state
  and does not add another row.
- Manual approval: setting `approved_at` in D1 lets the same email enter the app
  after wallet sign-in.
- Reuse prevention: after the first wallet signature is saved, a different
  wallet/signature for that email is rejected by the app gate.
- Attribution: only `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `ref`, and the
  referrer hostname are stored within the documented limits.
- Privacy: logs and D1 rows contain no IP address, user agent, or full referrer
  URL.

## Rollback

List deployments and identify the previous good Worker version:

```bash
npm exec --workspace @kettigo/landing wrangler deployments list
```

Restore the previous Worker version:

```bash
npm exec --workspace @kettigo/landing wrangler rollback <version-id>
```

The waitlist migrations are additive for data retention. Leave them in place
during Worker rollback because dropping waitlist data is not a safe rollback.

## Manual Browser Review

After starting `npm run landing:dev`, inspect 320px, 390px, 768px, 1024px, and
1440px widths. Confirm there is no horizontal scrolling; keyboard navigation
reaches every control; focus is visible; reduced-motion mode suppresses motion;
CTA anchors land on the expected sections; status messages receive focus after
submission; temporary failures keep form values; and no request reaches smart
contracts.

## Operator Checklist

- `npm install`
- `npm run landing:typecheck`
- `npm run landing:test`
- `npm run landing:build`
- Local migration and email approval succeed.
- Production D1 database ID replaces `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.
- Remote migration applies before remote approvals.
- Preview deployment passes waitlist join, replay, approval, and app gate smoke
  tests before the custom domain is connected.
